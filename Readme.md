# ClearList

## Overview

Welcome to the ClearList. This project is designed to manage your to-do list. The project is divided into two main components:

- **Frontend:** Handles the user interface and user experience.
- **Backend:** Manages the data processing, storage, and API endpoints.

## Repositories

The project is split into two separate repositories:

1. **Frontend Repository:** [Frontend Repo Link](https://github.com/sarin32/to-do-list-frontend)
2. **Backend Repository:** [Backend Repo Link](https://github.com/sarin32/to-do-list-backend)

## Endpoints

Below is the deployed frontend URL which is deployed in Netlify.

The backend is deployed in Render

Note: The backend will spin down due to inactivity because it is the free tier that I am using. So the first request to the backend might take a long time.
